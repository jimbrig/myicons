## Overview

The goal of `myicons` is to assist R shiny developers allowing them to 
manage their own personal, categorized icon library. 

Additionally, myicons helps automate rapid shiny-app prototyping via the use of 
the `random_icon` function which generates a random icon on the fly. 

## Installation

Install myicons from GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jimbrig/myicons")
```
