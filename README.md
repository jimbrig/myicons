## Overview

The goal of `myicons` is to assist R shiny developers allowing them to
manage their own personal, categorized icon library.

Additionally, myicons helps automate rapid shiny-app prototyping via the
use of the `random_icon` function which generates a random icon on the
fly.

## Installation

Install myicons from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jimbrig/myicons")
```
